## The design aesthetic

A lot of companies talk about missions of innovation but are mired in how much wealth they can transfer to their shareholders. On the fingers of one hand, one can tally true innovation in product quality, aesthetics, and attention to engineered detail.

### The aesthetics

There is the engineering beauty of the ERS-7.

### Challenges

To get the notion of Aperios and Open-R sorted, as it is what I need.

### Aperios and Open-R

Aperios is Sony's Proprietary Real-Time Operating system, used in all AIBOs, QRIO and some other consumer devices. Aperios OS was intended to be widely deployed, using real-time capabilities to handle multiple audio and visual data streams concurrently. The operating system was not widely adopted, and by 2003 Sony had stopped active development with COO Kunitake Ando commenting "Aperios was an operating system of a pre-Internet age and we decided that it isn't adequate for the future".

The OPEN-R architecture is specific to entertainment robots. The architecture involves the use of modular hardware components, such as appendages that can be easily removed and replaced to change the shape and function of the robots, and modular software components that can be interchanged to change their behavior and movement patterns. AIBO's creator, Doi, called OPEN-R the "masterpiece" of the AIBO development project, arguing it would minimize the need for programming individual movements or responses, and its "open" nature would encourage a global community of robot specialists and programmers to add capability.
